# FightR 2
FightR is a cross-platform 2D platform game written in C++11, using SFML for graphics rendering. The original game was written for Windows in 2007, link and comparison will be available later. To distinguish, this is version 2.

## How to compile and run
On Ubuntu, be sure to install SFML by `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`. Then, it's as simple as running this repo, step in the `src` directory, run `make`, then run the `a.out` file.

Instructions for Windows and OS X will follow later when things are working.
